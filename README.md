# chess
Contains a webscrapper used to scrape a database of chess games.  Intention is to eventually build a chess game opener classifier.

So far only the scrapping of the pgn games from pgnmentor.com as been completed (see pgnmentor_scrapper.ipynb).
Note: The SSL Certificate for the 'https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html' is no longer valid which prevents safely scrapping any more from that page.
